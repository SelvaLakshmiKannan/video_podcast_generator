# video_podcast_generator
This project builds an AI-powered video podcast generator that turns a topic into a 2â€“3 minute video with auto-generated script, voice, and visuals. It uses Hugging Face models, gTTS, and MoviePy. Challenges included syncing audio and visuals and ensuring offline compatibility. It was a great learning experience in AI media workflows.
